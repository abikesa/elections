There have been instances in U.S. presidential history where candidates have faced each other in more than one election. One of the most notable examples is the series of debates between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. They first ran against each other in the 1796 election, with Adams winning the presidency and Jefferson becoming vice president. They then faced off again in the 1800 election, which resulted in a tie between them in the Electoral College, leading to Jefferson becoming president after a vote in the House of Representatives. Another example is the 1884 and 1888 elections, where Grover Cleveland and James G. Blaine were candidates in both elections, with Cleveland winning in 1884 and Benjamin Harrison winning in 1888.
